Pacman Game in C++ (Object-Oriented Programming)
I developed a modern implementation of the classic Pacman game using C++ in Visual Studio, applying object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. This project highlights my skills in game development, AI-based movement, and structured programming.

Project Overview
This game is a console-based Pacman game where the player navigates through a maze, collects pellets, and avoids ghosts while progressing through multiple levels. Power pellets allow Pacman to eat ghosts for a short time. The game features a real-time scoring system and customizable settings.

Key Features
Smooth Movement – Implemented intelligent ghost movement patterns.
Scoring System – Tracks and updates the player’s score dynamically.
Power Pellets – Grants Pacman the ability to eat ghosts temporarily.
Customizable Settings – Players can adjust speed, difficulty level, and number of lives.
Technologies Used
Programming Language – C++
Development Environment – Visual Studio (2019 or later recommended)
Installation Guide
Prerequisites
Visual Studio 2019 or later
C++ development workload installed
Steps to Run the Game
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Syedmashaf-14/pacman-game-cpp.git  
Open the project in Visual Studio:
Navigate to the pacman-game-cpp folder
Open the Pacman.sln file

How to Play
Controls: Use W, A, S, D to move Pacman up, left, down, or right.
Objective:
Collect all pellets in the maze to progress to the next level.
Avoid ghosts or eat them after consuming a power pellet.
Winning: Clear all levels without losing all lives.
Losing: Lose all lives by getting caught by ghosts.
Project Roadmap
Implement basic Pacman movement and pellet collection.
Improve ghost AI for dynamic behavior.
Enhance game mechanics with additional power-ups.
