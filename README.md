# Pacman Game
I developed a Pacman Game in C++, utilizing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles
to create a structured and interactive console-based game. This project showcases my skills in game development
, AI-based movement, and structured programming.

## Overview
This game follows the classic Pacman mechanics, where the player navigates through a maze,
collecting pellets while avoiding ghosts. The objective is to clear the board by eating 
all the pellets while strategically using power pellets to turn the ghosts vulnerable for a limited time.

## Features
Object-Oriented Design – Implemented classes for Pacman, Ghosts, Maze, and Game Controller for a modular structure.
Ghost AI Movement – Ghosts follow a predefined AI-based movement logic to chase Pacman.
Dynamic Maze Representation – The maze is stored in a 2D array, allowing easy modifications.
Real-time Scoring System – Tracks the player’s progress dynamically.
Power Pellets – Temporarily allow Pacman to eat ghosts for extra points.
Customizable Settings – Adjust speed, difficulty level, and the number of lives.

## How to Play
1. Run the executable file.
2. Roll the dice on your turn.
3. Move forward according to the dice value.
4. If you land on a ladder, you move up; if you land on a snake, you slide down.
5. The first player to reach the final position wins the game.

## Controls
-Controls: Use W, A, S, D to move Pacman up, left, down, or right.
Objective:
Collect all pellets in the maze to progress to the next level.
Avoid ghosts or eat them after consuming a power pellet.
Winning: Clear all levels without losing all lives.
Losing: Lose all lives by getting caught by ghosts.

## Tech Stack Used
C++ – Core game logic and object-oriented programming.
Visual Studio – Development environment.
File Handling – Used to store maze configurations and game progress.

## Prerequisites
Visual Studio 2019 or later
C++ development workload installed
