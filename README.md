#Pacman Game in C++ (Object-Oriented Programming):
I developed a Pacman Game in C++, utilizing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create a structured and interactive console-based game. This project showcases my skills in game development, AI-based movement, and structured programming.

##Project Overview
This game follows the classic Pacman mechanics, where the player navigates through a maze, collecting pellets while avoiding ghosts. The objective is to clear the board by eating all the pellets while strategically using power pellets to turn the ghosts vulnerable for a limited time.

##Key Features
Object-Oriented Design – Implemented classes for Pacman, Ghosts, Maze, and Game Controller for a modular structure.
Ghost AI Movement – Ghosts follow a predefined AI-based movement logic to chase Pacman.
Dynamic Maze Representation – The maze is stored in a 2D array, allowing easy modifications.
Real-time Scoring System – Tracks the player’s progress dynamically.
Power Pellets – Temporarily allow Pacman to eat ghosts for extra points.
Customizable Settings – Adjust speed, difficulty level, and the number of lives.
##Tech Stack Used
C++ – Core game logic and object-oriented programming.
Visual Studio – Development environment.
File Handling – Used to store maze configurations and game progress.
Installation Guide
Prerequisites
Visual Studio 2019 or later
C++ development workload installed
##Steps to Run the Game
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Syedmashaf-14/pacman-game-cpp.git  
Open the project in Visual Studio:
Navigate to the pacman-game-cpp folder
Open the Pacman.sln file
Build the project:
Select Build → Build Solution from the menu (or press Ctrl+Shift+B)
Run the project:
Press F5 to start debugging or Ctrl+F5 to run without debugging
How to Play
Controls: Use W, A, S, D to move Pacman up, left, down, or right.
Objective:
Collect all pellets in the maze to progress to the next level.
Avoid ghosts or eat them after consuming a power pellet.
Winning: Clear all levels without losing all lives.
Losing: Lose all lives by getting caught by ghosts.
Project Roadmap
Implement basic Pacman movement and pellet collection.
Improve ghost AI for more dynamic behavior.
Add more power-ups and advanced game mechanics.
